    <h1>Abstraction ðŸŽ­</h1>
    <p>
      Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computational thinking that allows us to simplify complex problems by focusing on the essential details while filtering out unnecessary information. By creating simplified models, we make it easier to understand, communicate, and solve challenges effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Abstraction</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine trying to navigate Jakarta with a map that shows every single street, alley, and detail â€“ it would be chaotic and overwhelming! Abstraction lets us create a streamlined map that highlights only the major roads and landmarks, making navigation simpler and more efficient. In programming, abstraction means breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable parts, so each component focuses on a specific task. This process not only simplifies development but also enhances collaboration and maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you abstract, youâ€™re not ignoring the details; you're choosing to highlight what truly matters. This skill is critical not only in computer science but also in fields such as design, art, and even everyday decision-making.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-Life Applications in Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©</h2>
    <p>
      Abstraction is evident in many aspects of Indonesian life. Consider public transportation maps in cities like Jakarta or Bandung. These maps do not display every street or stop but instead focus on key transit routes and major stations. This abstraction helps commuters quickly understand the best routes without getting bogged down by superfluous details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in traditional Indonesian batik, artists use abstract patterns and symbols to represent complex stories and cultural values. The simplified designs capture the essence of the narrative without overwhelming the viewer with every intricate detail.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantages of Abstraction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Distills complex systems into clear, manageable models.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Clarity:</strong> Focuses on the core aspects that matter, making it easier to understand problems and communicate solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Streamlines problem-solving by eliminating unnecessary clutter, allowing for quicker and more effective decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Fosters Creativity:</strong> By reducing complexity, abstraction can open the door to innovative approaches and fresh perspectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Abstraction vs. Detailed Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      Detailed thinking involves getting lost in the minutiae, which can often lead to information overload and hinder decision-making. In contrast, abstraction allows you to zoom out and see the bigger picture. The table below illustrates the differences:
    </p>
    <div class="table-wrapper">
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Abstraction</th>
            <th>Detailed Thinking</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Focus</td>
            <td>Highlights essential elements</td>
            <td>Emphasizes every minor detail</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Clarity</td>
            <td>Provides a clear, simplified view</td>
            <td>Can be overwhelming and cluttered</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Efficiency</td>
            <td>Speeds up problem-solving</td>
            <td>May slow down decision-making</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Innovation</td>
            <td>Encourages creative solutions</td>
            <td>Limits perspective by focusing on minutiae</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h2>Fun Facts & Cultural Insights ðŸŽ‰</h2>
    <p>
      Abstraction is not only a modern computing tool; it also has deep roots in Indonesian culture. For instance, the traditional art of <em>wayang kulit</em> (shadow puppetry) uses abstract silhouettes to represent characters and stories. These simplified figures capture the essence of their subjects, leaving room for the audience's imagination to fill in the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, many Indonesian proverbs convey wisdom through metaphor and abstraction. These sayings distill complex life lessons into memorable, simple phrases, much like how abstraction in programming condenses intricate processes into easy-to-understand modules.
