    <h1>Computational Thinking üöÄ</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome! Let's explore the fascinating world of Computational Thinking üß†üí°. This page is designed with an Indonesian perspective, including local context, fun facts, and real-life examples to show you how this approach can transform everyday life.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is Computational Thinking? ü§ñ</h2>
    <p>
      Computational Thinking is a method of problem-solving that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, recognizing patterns, abstracting unnecessary details, and creating step-by-step solutions. It's not just for computer scientists‚Äîit's a valuable skill for everyone!
    </p>
    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400" alt="Computational Thinking Diagram">
    
    <h2>History and Context üìú</h2>
    <p>
      The term ‚ÄúComputational Thinking‚Äù was popularized by Jeannette Wing in 2006, though its roots date back to the early days of computer science with pioneers like Alan Turing. In Indonesia, a country with a rapidly growing tech scene and vibrant startup culture (think Gojek and Tokopedia), these skills are becoming indispensable for innovation and everyday problem-solving.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Methods of Computational Thinking üî•</h2>
    <p>
      Computational Thinking is built on several key methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>üß© Decomposition:</strong> Breaking down a complex problem into manageable pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>üîç Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying trends and commonalities to simplify problems.</li>
      <li><strong>üé≠ Abstraction:</strong> Focusing on the important details while ignoring the irrelevant ones.</li>
      <li><strong>üõ† Algorithm Design:</strong> Developing a clear, step-by-step strategy to solve problems efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Computational vs. Conventional Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a side-by-side comparison of Computational Thinking and Conventional Thinking:
    </p>
    <div class="table-wrapper">
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Computational Thinking</th>
            <th>Conventional Thinking</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Approach</td>
            <td>Systematic breakdown and analysis</td>
            <td>Often based on intuition and experience</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Methodology</td>
            <td>Algorithmic, logical, and step-by-step</td>
            <td>Heuristic and sometimes ad-hoc</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Application</td>
            <td>Used in tech, research, and problem-solving across industries</td>
            <td>Common in everyday decisions without formal structure</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>Designing an app to navigate Jakarta traffic</td>
            <td>Relying on past experience to choose a route</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Advantages of Computational Thinking in Daily Life üåü</h2>
    <p>
      Computational Thinking can improve many aspects of daily life. Here are some advantages with local examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Problem-Solving:</strong> From planning a trip to Bali to managing daily tasks, breaking problems down into smaller parts makes solutions more accessible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Better Decision Making:</strong> Systematically analyzing options can help when choosing the fastest route through Jakarta's notorious traffic or budgeting during festive seasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Creativity:</strong> Identifying patterns and abstracting key details can lead to innovative ideas‚Äîlike new ways to enjoy traditional Indonesian cuisine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Academic and Professional Growth:</strong> As Indonesia's tech startups boom, these skills offer a competitive edge in education and the workforce.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Fun Facts and Local Insights üòÑ</h2>
    <p>
      Did you know? Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in Southeast Asia. Local innovators are using computational thinking to tackle challenges in urban planning, sustainable agriculture, and even disaster management. Keep an eye on emerging tech scenes in Bandung, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta‚Äîthey're shaping the future!
